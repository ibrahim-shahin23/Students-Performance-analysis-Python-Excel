Using tools like Excel, Power BI, and Python
I examined factors like study hours, attendance, parental involvement, resources, extracurricular activities, and more.
I was able to uncover valuable insights and build predictive models to find the key determinants of student success.
Our analysis involved creating a comprehensive dashboards to visualize the data.
And I built predictive models using regression algorithms like multiple linear regression, SVR, and neural networks. 
These models allowed us to forecast student performance and identify areas for improvement.
